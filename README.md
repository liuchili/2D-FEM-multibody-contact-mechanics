# 2D-FEM-Multibody-contact-mechanics

This repository contains the 2D FEM Multibody contact mechanics code described in the paper "Emerging contact force heterogeneity in ordered soft granular media", which is currently under review at the Journal of Mechanics and Physics of Solids. A link to the accepted paper will be updated in due course.
