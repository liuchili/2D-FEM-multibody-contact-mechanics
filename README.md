# 2D-FEM-Multibody-contact-mechanics

This repository contains the 2D FEM Multibody contact mechanics code described in the paper "Emerging contact force heterogeneity in ordered soft granular media" (), which is currently under review. A link to the published paper will be updated in due course.

Part of the implementation was done when the author was a graduate student at Caltech, while the rest of the implementation is completed at Berkeley Lab where the author is currently a postdoc.
