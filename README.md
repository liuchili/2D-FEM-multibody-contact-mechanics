# 2D-FEM-Multibody-contact-mechanics

This repository contains the 2D FEM Multibody contact mechanics code described in the paper "Emerging contact force heterogeneity in ordered soft granular media" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmat.2021.104055)

Part of the implementation was done when the author was a graduate student at Caltech.
